== About
This is a minimalist Debian 12 (preferred) or Ubuntu Server seedbox setup that is oriented around fast and stable seeding, for both private and public trackers. It also covers optionally setting up qBittorent and Plex through a VPN.

It is bare-metal, not using any Dockers, so networking performance for 10gbit servers doesn't suffer.

This guide has a lot of security measures / hardening done, so have patience when working through this guide.

.Buying a server
[%collapsible]
====
Hetzner's https://www.hetzner.com/sb/#cpuType=Intel&additional=iNIC&location=FSN[Auction House dedicated servers] are preferred as it provides the best value; you get powerful hardware, a truly unlimited 1gbps line that is shared with nobody else, and good peering/routing.

For Hetzner, be sure to select an Intel CPU as it has an iGPU, which is useful for Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin; avoid Xeons, they have worse IPC which will impact libtorrent's performance -- the most critical part of qBittorrent, as it's effectively an interface for libttorrent.

* AMD CPUs are better value if you never use streaming services (Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin).

* Select the FSN or NBG location for better peering, and use an Intel iNIC as it uses less CPU than alternative network cards, and can handle a high number of global connections via libtorrent.

If you're paranoid about DDoS attacks, get an OVH unmetered from https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/bare-metal/prices/?display=list&storage=SATA&storage_volume=2000%7C22000[their website], and also check what https://discord.gg/7Gv8tdM[Andy10gbit on Discord] has to offer for OVH servers. Do note that OVH is significantly more expensive than Hetzner.

====


== 1. Prerequisites
On Hetzner, format and install Debian 12 as RAID0 if applicable, as to not waste any storage and increase drive speeds. Also ensure `/home` and `/` are not separate partitions, meaning only `/` is used, and make `/` a XFS partition instead of ext4.

* It's preferred to backup externally, instead of relying on RAID1.
** https://serverpartdeals.com/collections/manufacturer-recertified-hdd[Serverpartdeals] is the best company in the US selling manufacturer recertified drives. Their packaging is paranoid, shipping times are fast, and the warranty is good -- although they won't cover the shipping label's cost.
** Backing up this way will save a lot of money compared to paying Hetzner for backups, but will rely on you having fast download and upload speeds at home to do comfortably.

Login as the `root` user after Debian's installation is complete, or use `sudo -i` to escalate to root privileges.

Install sudo: +
`# apt install sudo`

If the current user is root, make an administrator account instead to avoid mistakes. By default it'll be a user, unprivileged, but can escalate to root via using `sudo` before a command: +
`# useradd -m -G sudo -s /bin/bash server`

Set the passphrase to something moderately complex using a password manager like Bitwarden. I recommend at least 30 characters long, lower & upper case characters with numbers, and no symbols. +
`# passwd server`

Login to 'server' and test if sudo works (it should output -> root): +
`sudo whoami`

The 'server' user is now going to be used instead of using 'root' directly.

TIP: If you're using a laptop as a server, set `HandleLidSwitchExternalPower=ignore` in `/etc/systemd/login.conf`. +
Then run: `sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind`

Remove Hetzner repositories, as it can make the OS lag behind in package updates, which is bad for security: +
`sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hetzner-security-updates.list; sudo rm /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99hetzner`

Sudo edit `/etc/apt/sources.list`, and remove all lines containing Hetzner. 

TIP: *irqbalance* balances interrupts across CPU cores to handle high load more efficiently, which can prevent low networking performance. +
*AppArmor* is to stop software from doing what they shouldn't, hence better security. +
*auditd & apparmor-notify* is to allow viewing AppArmor logs, but also installing auditd allows AppArmor profiles to be created by you. +
*Unattended upgrades* is so you don't accidentally forget to update packages, which would cause security issues. +
*UFW* is a firewall management tool for blocking off unused ports. +
*Fail2ban* is to make bruteforce password attacks on SSH and your web server (nginx) much more difficult. +
*apt-transport-https* is to allow apt to operate over HTTPS to prevent security flaws such as https://justi.cz/security/2019/01/22/apt-rce.html[RCEs].

`sudo apt update && sudo apt install irqbalance apparmor apparmor-utils auditd apparmor-notify unattended-upgrades apt-listchanges ufw fail2ban python3-systemd apt-transport-https ansible`

.*For Ubuntu:* Setting up kernel hotpatching support; to update the kernel automatically without rebooting.
. `sudo apt install ubuntu-advantage-tools`
. You have to make an Ubuntu account to use Ubuntu Pro's functionality: +
`sudo ua attach`

*For Debian:* You can https://tuxcare.com/blog/how-to-try-or-purchase-kernelcare-2-different-ways/[purchase KernelCare+] for $5.95 per server per month or $71 per server per year, it also hotpatches glibc and OpenSSL, which Ubuntu Pro doesn't cover.


*For Debian:* +
Sudo edit `/etc/apt/sources.list` and change `http://` to `https://`, also enable the backports repository: +
image:apt https.png[]

NOTE: If bookworm-backports is not there, use this: +
`deb https://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib non-free-firmware` +
Then run `sudo apt update`.

Sudo edit `/etc/fstab` and add "noatime" to the XFS partition: +
image:fstab.png[]

// Do this before hardening via dev-sec, otherwise they'll be locked out.
Run `ssh-keygen` on your local computer/PC, use the default location unless you already have an SSH key there (in that case, put it elsewhere and remember it), then set the passphrase to something moderately complex using a password manager like Bitwarden. I recommend at least 30 characters long, lower & upper case characters with numbers, and no symbols.

* Include `-i /DIRECTORY/TO/YOUR_FILE` if you put a custom location and/or name: +
`ssh-copy-id -p YOUR_SSH_PORT server@YOUR_SERVER_IP`

* Check on the server to see if your key was installed successfully: +
`cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys`

* Login with only the SSH key for the 'server' user, and if it works, proceed with the next hardening step.

Install what we'll use to automatically harden lots of settings relating to SQL, nginx, Linux, and SSH; note that for Debian 12 this will take a really long time, while on Ubuntu it's fast: +
`sudo ansible-galaxy collection install -U devsec.hardening --force -vvv`

Edit: `~/harden.yaml`; change the SSH server port to what you forwarded for your VPN if applicable:
```yaml
- name: Do hardening via dev-sec's collection
  hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - devsec.hardening.os_hardening
    - devsec.hardening.ssh_hardening
  vars:
    - ssh_server_ports: ["55820"]
```

.Setup the firewall:
- `sudo ufw allow YOUR_SSH_PORT`
- `sudo ufw allow https`

Now we automatically harden: +
`sudo ansible-playbook ~/harden.yaml`

Complete the firewall setup; this will kick you out of the SSH session, relogin in with the new SSH port. +
`sudo ufw default deny incoming; sudo ufw default allow outgoing; sudo ufw enable`

Sudo edit `/etc/default/grub`:

* Remove `nomodeset` to allow the Intel iGPU to run, which is desirable for Plex, Emby, or Jellyfin.
** Also run: `sudo sed -i 's/^blacklist i915/#&/' /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-hetzner.conf`

* Add `transparent_hugepage=never numa_balancing=disable` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT`, this aids in maintaining low networking latency.

* Add the kernel command line options from the https://kernsec.org/wiki/index.php/Kernel_Self_Protection_Project/Recommended_Settings#kernel_command_line_options[Kernel Self Protection Project], and include the x86_64 options too. I would recommend using the "slow" options at first, to see if your server can handle it.

- To make it easy (please check the KSPP link and compare): +

Generate the new boot configuration: +
`sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

Sudo edit `/etc/sysctl.d/99-custom.conf`; note that these settings might be wasteful on 1gbps servers, but there shouldn't be a perceivable negative impact from it:

NOTE: You can skip Swizzin installation if you already have it, for example, through hostingby.design's Swizzin OS template. +
hostingby.design and Andy10gbit would in that case already have qBittorrent using libtorrent v1.2.x installed. +
If you want Plex though, run `sudo box install plex`

.Install Swizzin, which are high-quality automation scripts to make administrating a seedbox easier; through which we *install qBittorrent and optionally Plex*
[%collapsible]
====

Use libtorrent v1.2.x instead of v2, as v2 has issues with disk performance / caching. +
`sudo -i`
`# export libtorrent_github_tag=RC_1_2`

Retreive then run Swizzin: +
`# bash <(wget -qO - s5n.sh) && . ~/.bashrc`

.Through Swizzin, install the following:
* panel
* nginx
* qbittorrent -> 4.3.9 or 4.6.5 depending on your preferences
* plex (only if you're streaming movies / TV shows)

See https://swizzin.ltd/getting-started/box-basics[here] for how to interact with Swizzin after its installation.

Exit the root user: +
`# exit`

====

// fail2ban is done after nginx is installed so it doesn't error on [nginx-http-auth].
The following steps are required to make fail2ban work: +
`echo "sshd_backend = systemd" | sudo tee -a /etc/fail2ban/paths-debian.conf`

Sudo edit `/etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local`: +
```
[DEFAULT]
allowipv6 = auto
backend = systemd
banaction = ufw
banaction_allports = ufw
bantime = 2h
ignoreip = 127.0.0.1/8

enabled = true
port = http,https
logpath = %(nginx_error_log)s

`sudo systemctl restart fail2ban`

Additional hardening via AppArmor: +
`sudo apt install -t bookworm-backports golang-go`

* If those two packages don't exist, run: + 
`echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian bookworm-backports main contrib non-free' | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list`

Follow https://apparmor.pujol.io/install/[AppArmor.d's official instructions] on installing additional AppArmor profiles.

* If there is a broken AppArmor profile, remove it, such as +
`sudo rm /etc/apparmor.d/home.tor-browser.firefox`.

Sudo edit `/etc/apparmor.d/qbittorrent-nox` and add the following line (that contains @{HOME}): +
image:qbittorrent apparmor.png[] +
Remove `/storage/` if not applicable.

Now we can enforce AppArmor profiles for our web-facing applications: +
`sudo aa-enforce -d /etc/apparmor.d qbittorrent-nox php-fpm`

Restart the server to apply our GRUB and sysctl changes: +
`sudo systemctl reboot`

== 2. Setting up qBittorrent
Open the Swizzin panel, which should be on the root of your IP such as https://EXAMPLE_IP.

Click the Gear icon to go into the settings.

.*Downloads*

== 3. (Optional) Setting up a VPN for qBittorrent and Plex

This is to avoid complaints to Hetzner that would get your server shut down, which will always happen on public trackers, but are rare on private trackers.

WARNING: This will slow down 10gbit servers to around 1.2gbit.

.Instructions
[%collapsible]
====

Here we're going to use https://airvpn.org/?referred_by=224244[AirVPN] (referral link, thank you if you use it); their servers are reliable, fast, and support port forwarding which is a requirement. I've personally used them since 2016, and struggled to find better VPNs, especially when needing port forwarding.

`sudo ufw route allow in on wg0; sudo ufw allow 1637/udp`

Open AirVPN's website, go to "Client Area", then "VPN Devices -> Manage". Here you assign a new device with whatever name you want; personally I'd name it "Hetzner".

Go back into "Client Area", then go to "Config Generator".

* Choose "Linux" as the OS, click the slider for "Wireguard UDP 1637", then select your device. Now pick a server that has a 20000mbit/s (10gbps up and down) link; for Germany, their Netherlands servers are most suitable, while for Finland it would be Sweden.
- At the bottom of the page, click "Generate".

Rename the generated VPN file to "wg0" ("wg0.conf" if you enabled file extensions in your OS).

Edit "wg0.conf":

* Change the `MTU` to 1420.
* Remove the line containing `PersistentKeepalive`.

Install Wireguard on the server: +
`sudo apt install wireguard resolvconf`

Sudo edit `/opt/swizzin/swizzin.cfg` and add `FORMS_LOGIN = False`

NOTE: This is required to login to the Swizzin panel when using alternative ports.

Move "wg0.conf" to `/etc/wireguard`; use an SFTP program such as https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla] if you need to.

Sudo edit `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default`

- Change the listen port from 443 to a port you have forwarded in AirVPN, note that the port and local port cannot differ on AirVPN's website. 

Using your Swizzin user, edit `~/.config/qBittorrent/qBittorrent.conf`:

- Change `WebUI\LocalHostAuth` to *false*.
** It's safe to bypass the localhost login requirement since Nginx protects this page already with a login.

Sudo edit `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, and change the Port to one you've port forwarded with AirVPN, note that again, the port and local port cannot differ on AirVPN's website.

As root: +
`sudo systemctl restart ssh nginx panel qbittorrent@YOUR_SWIZZIN_USER`

Enable the VPN on the server: +
`sudo wg-quick up wg0`

Open the qBittorrent UI, likely https://example.airdns.org:12345

Click the Gear icon to go into the settings.

.*Advanced*
* Network interface: wg0

Now for Plex, go to the URL -- likely https://example.airdns.org:54321 (this must have its local port set to 32400), then click the wrench icon, go to Settings -> Remote Access, and make sure it looks similar to the following: +
image:plex port.png[]

====

== Tips
Check your successful server logins occassionally with: +
`sudo last -w -F`

View the AppArmor denials for 1 day: +
`sudo aa-notify -s 1 -v`

Reload an AppArmor profile after changing it: +
`sudo aa-enforce THE_PROFILE`

Monitor system resources live; run without `sudo` to view the current user's processes only: +
`sudo htop`

== Private tracker tips
.*Myanonamouse*

Setting a dynamic seedbox IP: + 

Your username -> Preferences -> Security -> Create session with the IP -> go back to Security -> then click "Allow session to set dynamic seedbox IP": +
image:MAM allow dynamic.png[] +
image:MAM cookie.png[]

== File transfers / backups
There are three good options, two graphical, one command-line, depending on what you're comfortable with.

=== Graphical

.https://syncthing.net/[Syncthing]
* This is an okay option for syncing across drives or servers, the downside is the long wait time for a first folder scan.
- `sudo box install syncthing` on the server(s).

.https://filezilla-project.org/[FileZilla]
- This is the fastest SFTP client for downloads; given the following option is set to 10: +
image:simultaneous transfers.png[]

== Command-line

.rsync
- On the server (example is of moving all files under `/home/EXAMPLE_USER/torrents/qbittorrent/` to IP 31.3.3.7 on SSH port 6969): + 
`rsync --progress -atvz /home/EXAMPLE_USER/torrents/qbittorrent/* -e 'ssh -p 6969' EXAMPLE_USER@31.3.3.7:/home/EXAMPLE_USER/torrents/qbittorrent`
